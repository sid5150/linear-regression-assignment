# Linear Regression Assignment

This repository contains the submission for the Linear Regression Assignment, focusing on predicting the demand for shared bikes. The assignment involves building a multiple linear regression model and performing extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the factors affecting bike rentals.

## Contents

### 1. Jupyter Notebook
- **notebook.ipynb**: A well-commented Jupyter Notebook that includes the following:

## Project Description

### Business Goal

BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, aims to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes to optimize operations and marketing strategies in the post-COVID-19 market.

### Dataset

The dataset contains daily bike rental data with features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, season, and weather situation. The target variable is the total count of bike rentals (cnt).

#### Methodology

	•	Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
	•	EDA: Using visualizations like box plots, histograms, and time series plots.
	•	Feature Engineering: Creating dummy variables and transforming features.
	•	Model Building and Evaluation: Constructing a multiple linear regression model and evaluating it using R-squared and other metrics.
